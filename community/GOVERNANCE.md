# Kubecuro Governance

This project is governed by the Open Source spirit of the CNCF.

## Maintainers
The maintainers are responsible for the strategic direction of Kubecuro.

## Decision Making
Decisions are made by consensus among maintainers. Major changes require a Proposal (KEP - Kubecuro Enhancement Proposal).

## Pro / Open Core
The `kubecuro` repository is 100% open source. The "Pro" edition is a commercial distribution that builds upon this open core via the Bridge Interface.
