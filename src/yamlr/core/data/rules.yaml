rules/no-latest-tag:
  name: Avoid Latest Tag
  severity: Warning
  description: Container images should use specific version tags instead of 'latest'.
  rationale: |
    Using `latest` makes deployments non-deterministic. A new version of the image could break your application 
    without any change to the manifest. Rollbacks become impossible because `latest` is a moving target.
  remediation: Pin the image to a specific SHA digest or version tag (e.g., `nginx:1.25.3`).

rules/resource-limits:
  name: Resource Limits Missing
  severity: Warning
  description: Containers should define resource requests and limits.
  rationale: |
    Without limits, a single container can consume all node resources (CPU/Memory), causing a Denial of Service 
    for other pods. Without requests, the scheduler cannot make intelligent placement decisions.
  remediation: Add a `resources` block with `requests` and `limits` for cpu and memory.

rules/run-as-root:
  name: Container Runs as Root
  severity: High
  description: Containers should run as a non-root user.
  rationale: |
    Running processes as root increases the attack surface. If the container is compromised, the attacker 
    has root privileges inside the container, which facilitates container escape attacks.
  remediation: Set `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true` and specify a `runAsUser` ID > 1000.
